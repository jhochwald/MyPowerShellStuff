# MyPowerShellStuff
PowerShell Stuff that I use on a regular/daily base.

Some are just shortcuts for stuff that I need to use often and based on the fact that I'm a lazy guy these are my convenience.

Other functions make Windows (or better the PowerShell) more to act like *nix! This is based on the fact that I'm a Mac guy and love to use all the nice BSD based commands.

I Dump the Full functions all the time (Due to the updated signature)
