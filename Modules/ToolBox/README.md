# What is this?
I was asked to publish my functions (Part of my regular PowerShell Profile) as a Module.
This is a version of them as Module.

# Any difference?
Yes there are differences between the Module Variante and my regular functions.
Some due to the fact that a Module is different to scripts.
And it is not allays on the latest version of the functions.
