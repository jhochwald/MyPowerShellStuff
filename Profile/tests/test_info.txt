PoSH Base Unit Tests

All tests are based on Pester, a BDD based test runner for PowerShell.

The tests are not documented well, but Pester uses a syntax that is very easy to understand and
it is mostly human readable

All Pester Unit Tests run during the Build process! A Build will be deployed for any further
tests (to Lead user or test systems) if all automated Unit tests are passed (or failed if they
should fail).
