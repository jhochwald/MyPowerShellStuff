# Profile #
Some neat functions and stuff that I use often.

Many things make PowerShell more *NIX like (I'm not a Windows Guy and want to use my typical BSD/Mac Stuff within my PowerShell sessions)

# Where are the NETX Modules? #
The NETX Modules is not published here!
The Reason is easy: **Licensing**!

The NETX Modules are commercial PowerShell Extensions with a lot of Exchange/Exchange Online/Hybrid, Office 365, Azure, and Mobile Device Management functions.

If you find a command or functions that is build on top of the NETX Modules, just replace the used command with the regular PowerShell version.

Hope that I implemented a "*Get-Command*" IF Loop around them...

That will work by 99% ;-)

We distribute this tools here together with the NET-Experts PowerShell Modules, so some parts have to use the Core and the Tools module (These 2 modules are the Core that every customer get).

But a while ago I decided to distribute the stuff here separately and under a easy to understand BSD like license on GitHub.
