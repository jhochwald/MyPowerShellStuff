Some neat functions and stuff that I use often.
Many things make PowerShell more *NIX like (I'm not a Windows Guy and want to use my typical BSD/Mac Stuff within my PowerShell sessions)

The PoSH Base Module is not published here!

-> The Reason: Licensing!

This module is a commercial PowerShell Extension with a lot of Exchange/Exchange Online/Hybrid, Office 365, Azure, and Mobile Device Management functions.

If you find a command or functions that is build on top of the PoSH Base Module, just replace the used command with the PowerShell version. That will work by 99% ;-)
