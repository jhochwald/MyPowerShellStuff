# Profile
Some neat functions and stuff that I use often.
Many things make PowerShell more *NIX like (I'm not a Windows Guy and want to use my typical BSD/Mac Stuff within my PowerShell sessions)

# Where is the PoSH Module?
The PoSH Base Module is not published here!
The Reason is easy: **Licensing**!

The PoSH Base Module is a commercial PowerShell Extension with a lot of Exchange/Exchange Online/Hybrid, Office 365, Azure, and Mobile Device Management functions.

If you find a command or functions that is build on top of the PoSH Base Module, just replace the used command with the regular PowerShell version. That will work by 99% ;-)

Feedback
Feedback is more then welcome!

# Contributing
If you find a problem or Bug, just let me know.
Or even better: Pull it, fix it and contribute ;-)

# Have something to add?
Do you have something that you think it should be a part of this? Just publish it and sent me the link.
If I like it, it will be a part of the next version here (formatted to fit and signed)
